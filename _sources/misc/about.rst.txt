.. rubric:: Computing

In 1983, I got a Commodore-64, an Abacus C compiler, and an apparently insatiable appetite for all things `UNIX`_.
I passionately advocate UNIX-style computing environments for business and pleasure.
My principle areas of interest are algorithms, computer architecture, networking, and system software (i.e., assemblers, compilers, and operating systems).
I am also seemingly obsessed with documentation systems (TeX, LaTeX, Texinfo, DocBook, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, Sphinx, and the UNIX "roff" family of typesetters all fitting comfortably within my repertoire).
I am a devotee of the FreeBSD UNIX-like operating system.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Purdue University,
a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Butler University,
and have held positions as a computer science practitioner for my entire career.

.. rubric:: Languages

I have an aptitude for pattern-recognition, and have always enjoyed human languages.
Fortunately, the middle school I attended offered an 18-week exploratory language survey of Spanish, French, and German.
After spending six weeks in each, students were expected to select one for further focus.
I chose Spanish because French was (to my mind) rather *froufrou* (French for "heavily ornamented" or "fancy"),
and the German instructor seemed, frankly, like a bitch.

Spanish was perhaps the only "school" subject I honestly ever cared about.
(I voraciously studied computers starting from age 12, but that was all on my own time.
I don't think my brain truly came alive until I hit 19: since then, I have been something of a learning addict.)
Because of my pattern recognition, I could excel easily without a ton of effort; and, besides, languages were fun.
I took many steps to befriend native speakers, and by the time I reached freshman year in high school, I was becoming proficient.

The language gods shined down on me again when my first high-school Spanish teacher entrusted me to work as the "International Day" student coordinator.
Each year many foreign-exchange students were living in Indiana with a host family.
My role was to match such a foreigner with a regular student from my high school,
have the former spend the night before at the latter's house,
then assist the day-of while the foreign-exchange students visited our high school.
There was also a party for everyone involved.
My executing this role all four years of high school got me exposed to many languages, cultures, and people.
I still have a beloved friend from Mexico, **Patricio**, due to this good fortune.

My high-school Spanish teachers (Pat Villas and John "Grande Juan" Evelo), saw burgeoning talent in me,
so in my junior year connected me with a group of Purdue University students who traveled to Spain the summer of 1987.
Looking back, I sense this international trip to be one of the most important events of my life.
To this day, I still have a cherished friend from Spain, **Isabel**, whom I met that summer of '87.

Upon returning from Spain, I worked as an official interpreter for the `1987 Pan American Games`_.
As I was interested in weight-lifting, I volunteered to help with the weight-lifting events.
My Spanish skills were strongly exercised (pun somewhat intended),
especially when I had to perform a live-TV translation for an interview with a Cuban athlete who had defected to the United States a few years earlier.

To this day, Spanish continues to be a key source of life-enrichment.

In the years leading up to 2020, I started desiring to learn a second foreign language.
My domestic partner (**Sheila**) enjoys French,
and because of French's role in American history, in the English language itself,
and in human history, I've decided to learn it.
After many hours of listening to native French-speakers on YouTube,
I've left behind my former opinion of it being *froufrou*,
and have come to appreciate its influence and intrinsic beauty.
One day, time and energy permitting, I'd like to learn German and Russian.
